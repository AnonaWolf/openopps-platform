<p>Hello <% if (given_name) { %><%- given_name %><% } %>,</p>

<p>The application review process, for the U.S. Department of State Student Internship Program (Unpaid), 
  has ended and the <strong>cycle is closed.</strong> You can no longer select interns or make changes to your applicant review board.
  Weâ€™ve archived all of the application review boards, but you can easily <a href="<%- archivelink %>">access the archived boards here.</a></p>
<p>
  What happens next?
</P>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Now that the review process has ended and the cycle is closed, we will:</li>
    <li>1.       Email each applicant selected for either a primary or alternate intern position with next steps.</li>
    <li>2.       Email all applicants who were not selected.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

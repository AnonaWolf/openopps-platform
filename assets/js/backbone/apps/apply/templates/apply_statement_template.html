          Your statement of interest is very importantâ€”those reviewing all of the applications rely heavily on these statements 
          when deciding who will get the internship. Make sure your statement of interest is well written, concise and tells your story.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tell us what you'll bring to the work and what you hope to take away from this experience.</li>
        <li>Highlight any disadvantages you've overcome or other relevant unique experiences and how it will help you successfully complete the internship.</li>
        <li>Expand on any of the questions asked in the application, such as your language ability or other special skills.</li>
